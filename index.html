          <p class="info">
            (Age 52) is most known as the guitarist for the Red Hot Chili
            Peppers. Born in 1970, Frusciante has been in the band off and on
            since 1988, but has been a musician for at least 34 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Frusciante first joined the band at the young age of 18 in 1988.
            Since then he has been apart of seven studio albums with the band. A
            few of his greatest influences include Jimi Hendrix, Frank Zappa,
            Lou Reed, followed by many more. What makes him one of the greatest
            guitarists ever is how he can balance his techical ability with an
            emphasis on feel. As a musician he never runs out of ideas which
            allows him to create music which provoke feelings that can sometimes
            be difficult to put into words.

            Frusciante also has a collection of solo works that cover different
            genres from Acoustic to Electronic:
